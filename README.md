# Cross-Compatible-ML-Library
Hey there,
This is an expansion on my Python neural network framework project started a couple months back. It was built intirely from scratch, using only the Numpy library. The final result can be viewed at https://tennis-ball.github.io/Character-Classification/

This project will feature the Python framework along with a translated Java and C++ one, for both conveniency and practice (for me). Please feel free to look around and make a PR if you see any issues, my Python skills well surpass those of Java or C++, and even then ML is a complex topic.

Yeet,
Mason
